# React Frontend test

## Aim

Using React create an interface where a user can type a company name which returns a filtered list of results, in groups of 10.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Create an input box where a user can enter the name of a company
- After the input of the 3rd character, render a filtered list of results which match the characters in the user input (there is an example json file with a sample set of results for you to work with)
- When the user removes the text from the search box, no results will be displayed
- Create a clear button which, when clicked, will clear the user input
- The rendered list will display results and associated metadata, as per wireframe
- If there are more than 10 matching items, render a “show more” button – when this button is clicked, the next 10 items should be revealed


The aim of this exercise is to test your React knowledge, therefore we do not expect you to use libraries for component functionality, i.e. react-autosuggest or react.autocomplete.

We expect you to be able to demo your work, so please ensure that your code can be rendered in a browser.

### What we're looking for

- Clean, maintainable, code backed by tests (using a library of your choice)
- A README file describing how to run the code and tests
- Git commits at regular intervals, demonstrating iterative development
- Pragmatism - i.e. no over-engineering
