# Task

Using React create an interface where a user can type a company name which returns a filtered list of results, in groups of 10.

When there are more than 10 results we expect to see a “show more” button which will reveal the next 10 item when clicked.

Look at company.json

The aim of this exercise is to demonstrate your React knowledge, therefore please do not use any additional libraries i.e. react-autosuggest, react.autocomplete etc.

We expect you to be able to demo your work, so please ensure that your code can be rendered in a browser.




## Behaviour

When entering a search term, after the input of the 3rd character, results will begin to render on the screen. (will see if they can configure the number of characters on the page)

Clearing the input box will remove the results from the page. (looks for hiding a div, or removing from dom)   

What we're looking for
- Clean, maintainable code
- Backed by tests
- README containing instructions for running app and tests
- Git commits at regular intervals, demonstrating iterative development
- Pragmatism - i.e. no over-engineering
